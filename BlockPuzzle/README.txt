To play the game, the player clicks on a puzzle piece
which implicitly selects the puzzle piece which was 
clicked on and moves it in the direction that the mouse
was dragged. 

Every time a piece is moved, the move counter increments.

when the reset puzzle button is pressed, the puzzle and
move counter resets and the screen refreshes.
